# Multi Language Todo Application

In this repository, I am going to build a basic todo application using different languages that I am going to learn. This will give me (or anyone who refer this) a strong understanding of how one can learn different REST API structuring across different languages.

Currently, I am planning for only TypeScript (Express) & Java (Spring Boot) but I might add a few more.

> Note: The typecript + express repo is developed using `node-typescript-gen` package

## Routes

The routes in this application is as follows:

POST: /tasks

GET: /tasks

PATCH: /tasks/:taskId/toggle

DELETE: /tasks/:taskId/delete
