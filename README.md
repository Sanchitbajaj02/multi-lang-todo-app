# Multi Language Todo Application

In this repository, I am going to build a basic todo application using different languages that I am going to learn. This will give me (or anyone who refer this) a strong understanding of how one can learn different REST API structuring across different languages.

Currently, I am planning for only TypeScript (Express) & Java (Spring Boot) but I might add a few more.

## Routes

There is going to be 2 major routex i.e., user routes and todo routes.
